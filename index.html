    My Master's thesis focused on using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to identify anti-cancer peptides. I wrote a paper with my advisor,
    Indika Kahanda, which has been accepted by the International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics
    (PACBB), and is currently pending publication.
