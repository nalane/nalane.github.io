    <span class="text">I was born and raised in Colorado Springs, CO, and went to Colorado School of Mines where I graduated in 2015</span>
    <i class="text">summa cum laude.</i>
    <span class="text">
        After doing a summer internship at Seagate, I started working on my Master's degree. However, after a long fight with cancer,
        my mom needed a full time care taker, and I dropped out in Spring 2016 to take care of her. She passed away quickly after that.

<p class="text">
    I took some time to reevaluate my goals, and I ultimately decided to go into industry rather than continue with my studies. I took
    up a job with Solute, Inc., a military subcontracting company, through which I worked for Lockheed Martin. Then, after only a couple
    of months there, my father became sick with cancer as well. This time, his battle was short, and he passed away in May 2017.

<p class="text">
    I quit my job to take care of his estate, grieve, and eventually move to Bozeman, MT, where I have family. I initially was not
    interested in continuing my Master's studies, but I ultimately decided to look into MSU's grad program, and I stumbled across
    Indika Kahanda's work in machine learning as applied to bioinformatics, which intrigued me. With his guidance, I have been able
    to conduct anti-cancer research, which is very important to me. After graduating with my Master's in Spring 2020, I decided to
    continue with my doctorate, which I am working on now.

        I have always had a love for theater and music. I performed in various plays throughout high school and college, and in 2014, 
        I directed a rendition of
