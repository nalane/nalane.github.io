                            After doing a summer internship at Seagate, I started working on my Master's degree. However, after a long fight with cancer,
                            my mom needed a full time care taker, and I dropped out in Spring 2016 to take care of her. She passed away quickly after that.

                    <p class="text">
                        I took some time to reevaluate my goals, and I ultimately decided to go into industry rather than continue with my studies. I took
                        up a job with Solute, Inc., a military subcontracting company, through which I worked for Lockheed Martin. Then, after only a couple
                        of months there, my father became sick with cancer as well. This time, his battle was short, and he passed away in May 2017.

                        I quit my job to take care of his estate, grieve, and eventually move to Bozeman, MT, where I have family. I initially was not
                        interested in continuing my Master's studies, but I ultimately decided to look into MSU's grad program, and I stumbled across
                        Indika Kahanda's work in machine learning as applied to bioinformatics, which intrigued me. With his guidance, I have been able
                        to conduct anti-cancer research, which is very important to me. After graduating with my Master's in Spring 2020, I decided to
                        continue with my doctorate, which I am working on now.
