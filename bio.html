                            After doing a summer internship at Seagate, I started working on my Master's degree. However, after a long fight with cancer,
                            my mom needed a full time care taker, and I dropped out in Spring 2016 to take care of her. She passed away quickly after that.

                    <p class="text">
                        I took some time to reevaluate my goals, and I ultimately decided to go into industry rather than continue with my studies. I took
                        up a job with Solute, Inc., a military subcontracting company, through which I worked for Lockheed Martin. Then, after only a couple
                        of months there, my father became sick with cancer as well. This time, his battle was short, and he passed away in May 2017.

                        I quit my job to take care of his estate, grieve, and eventually move to Bozeman, MT, where I have family. I initially was not
                        interested in continuing my Master's studies, but I ultimately decided to look into MSU's grad program, and I stumbled across
                        Indika Kahanda's work in machine learning as applied to bioinformatics, which intrigued me. With his guidance, I have been able
                        to conduct anti-cancer research, which is very important to me. After graduating with my Master's in Spring 2020, I decided to
                        continue with my doctorate, which I am working on now.

                            I have always had a love for theater and music. I performed in various plays throughout high school and college, and in 2014,

                        One of the best ways to get to know someone is to know what kinds of media they enjoy. Below are some of the things I've been
