<p class="text">
    It is worth noting that there are gaps in my history. Each of these was caused by my parents' cancers: I left Data Verity after my mother's 
    cancer was found to be terminal (though I did continue my studies at Colorado School of Mines), and I left Solute, Inc. after my father died 
    so that I could manage his estate and eventually move to Bozeman to be close to family. Frankly, I primarily took the time from May 2017, 
    when my father died, to January 2019, when I resumed my graduate studies at Montana State University, to grieve and reassess my goals.

<dl>
    <dt class="text">DeepACPpred</dt>
    <dd class="text">
        My Master's thesis project. I created a hybrid recurrent neural network(RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) system in Tensorflow 
        to predict if a given amino acid sequence represented an anti-cancer peptide (ACP). Subject of the paper "DeepACPpred: A Novel Hybrid CNN-RNN 
        Architecture for Predicting Anti-Cancer Peptides," listed above.

    <dt class="text">Fey Game Engine</dt>
    <dd class="text">
        A game engine written in C++. Utilizes both OpenGL and Vulkan. Mostly not in progress any more. Ultimately, I consider this project to have
        failed. The biggest lesson that I learned from this project is that while abstraction is a powerful tool, too much of it can make remembering how
        everything works difficult, since important implementation details are often hidden under layers upon layers of abstraction. Also, I got distracted
        by the Haskell version of the engine.

    <dt class="text">HaskFey Game Engine</dt>
    <dd class="text">
        A game engine written in Haskell. Haskell is a beautiful mess of a language, and I love it. I wanted to see how well Haskell works on a large-scale
        project, and so I decided to test it out with a game engine. Thus far, I have learned a lot about Haskell and how it works, and I am excited to
        keep this project alive.
